# Web-Design-Challenge

In this homework we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in past assignment . We have used weather data .

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

For building this website we have used HTML,CSS and Bootstrap.You can see the visualization by clicking on this link.
